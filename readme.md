# react-pixijs-renderer

**Note: This project is under construction, the usage and implementations might change over time. Use it at your own risk.**

This project implements a react renderer for `pixi.js`.
With this renderer, `pixi.js` objects can be managed in react, and the developing experience is improved.

Currently, this code of project is basically a `pixi.js` port of the awesome project `react-three-fiber`, I learnt so much from r3f.

What works now:

- Canvas
- Container
- Graphics
- Text

What's next:

- Loader
- Texture
- Sprite
- Examples
